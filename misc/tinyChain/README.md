I heard that the SecOps club deployed a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
!!! This is a beginner-level CTF challenge. (very very very easy) !!!
Your task is to create a wallet, load the contract at 0xEa8ACe377333cb07AC30C88f3673ad11fabD13Fa, and analyze the following Solidity code. The flag is hidden in the logic, figure it out, and it's yours.
!!! The contract is deployed on the Holesky test network !!!
- https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/holesky to get some ETH.
- https://remix.ethereum.org to compile and load the contract.
